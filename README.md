# Eye Tracking Based Control System 

Patients suffering from severe paralysis are usually dependent on others for assistance to moving around. Our team creates a complete solution that enables them to see the world independently. Weâ€™re using computer-vision-based eye-tracking and head pose estimation to receive commands from the user to control mouse cursor. 

By gazing their eyes right, left and center, blinking, winking, and move their head slightly, the user can drag and click the mouse cursor. The GUI comprises an onscreen keyboard to construct sentences and a list of suggested sentences to quickly generate simple conversation. This app is an inexpensive alternative for dedicated speech devices that are available on the market right now.
